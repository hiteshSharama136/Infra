- **How would you use Prometheus to identify the root cause of the downtime?**
  - Query metrics for anomalies in error rates, latency, or resource usage around the time of the incident.
- **Which Grafana panels and queries would be most useful for visualizing the issue?**
  - Use time-series graphs, heatmaps, and histograms to visualize metrics like error rates and response times.
- **How would you correlate logs with metrics to gain deeper insights?**
  - Use tools like Loki for logs and correlate them with Prometheus metrics on Grafana dashboards.
- **Describe the steps you would take to create a post-incident report using Grafana and Prometheus.**
  - Gather relevant metrics and logs, create visualizations in Grafana, and summarize findings in a report highlighting key metrics and timelines.

### 5. **Implementing Custom Metrics**

**Scenario:** You have a custom application that exposes specific business metrics (e.g., user signups, transactions) that you need to monitor.

**Questions and Answers:**
- **How would you instrument your application to expose custom metrics for Prometheus?**
  - Use a Prometheus client library to instrument your application and expose metrics at an HTTP endpoint.
- **What steps are involved in configuring Prometheus to scrape these custom metrics?**
  - Add the custom endpoint to Prometheus’s `scrape_configs` in the configuration file.
- **How would you create a Grafana dashboard to visualize the custom metrics?**
  - Create a new dashboard in Grafana and add panels that query and visualize the custom metrics.
- **Describe how you would alert on specific business metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.**
  - Define alerting rules in Prometheus for the custom metrics and configure Grafana to show these alerts.

## Technical Questions and Answers

### Prometheus

1. **What is Prometheus, and how does it differ from traditional monitoring systems?**
   - Prometheus is a time-series database that uses a pull-based model for collecting metrics, unlike traditional systems that use push-based models.
2. **Explain the architecture of Prometheus. How do the components like the Prometheus server, Alertmanager, and exporters interact?**
   - The Prometheus server scrapes metrics from exporters, stores them in a TSDB, and sends alerts to Alertmanager based on configured rules.
3. **What is a Prometheus exporter, and how do you use it?**
   - An exporter exposes metrics in a format Prometheus can scrape. Use exporters to collect metrics from various applications or services.
4. **Describe the PromQL query language. What are some common queries you might use?**
   - PromQL is a powerful query language for extracting and manipulating time-series data. Common queries include `rate()`, `sum()`, and `avg()`.
5. **How does Prometheus handle high cardinality of metrics?**
   - Prometheus handles high cardinality through efficient storage and indexing but may need optimizations for extremely high cardinality.
6. **What are the limitations of Prometheus, and how can they be mitigated?**
   - Limitations include storage size and query performance. Mitigate by using external storage solutions and optimizing queries.
7. **Explain how Prometheus handles data retention and storage.**
   - Prometheus stores data on disk and manages retention through configuration settings (`--storage.tsdb.retention`).
8. **How would you set up Prometheus for high availability (HA)?**
   - Deploy multiple Prometheus instances and use federation or a shared storage solution to ensure high availability.
9. **What is the role of Alertmanager in the Prometheus ecosystem?**
   - Alertmanager handles alerts sent by Prometheus, manages silences, and sends notifications to users.
10. **How do you configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from an application? Provide an example configuration.**
    - Configure `scrape_configs` in `prometheus.yml`:
      ```yaml
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'my_application'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8080']
      ```
